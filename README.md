A crop recommendation and yield prediction machine learning model aids farmers in choosing the best crop to grow in a specific location and forecasts the crop's production. The model is made to offer perceptions and advice that are particular to the farmer's area as well as other important elements like climate, precipitation, and temperature.

Combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques can be used to build the model. For instance, the model can recommend crops based on historical yield data and other relevant variables using supervised learning techniques like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. To find patterns in the data and classify them, the model can also apply unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering.

I evaluated the performance of three different algorithms for prediction tasks:
Linear Regression Algorithm: This algorithm showed limited accuracy for our prediction requirements, hence it was not suitable for our purposes.

Random Forest Algorithm: With a remarkable accuracy of 92.79%, the Random Forest Algorithm outperformed other models. Its effectiveness stems from its ability to mitigate overfitting, thereby providing robust predictions.

Decision Trees Algorithm: While the Decision Trees Algorithm demonstrated a respectable accuracy of 87.29%, it fell short in comparison to the Random Forest Algorithm. Decision trees tend to overfit the training data, which can lead to reduced generalization performance on unseen data. In contrast, Random Forest Algorithm, by aggregating multiple decision trees and incorporating randomness in the tree-building process, effectively addresses overfitting, resulting in superior prediction accuracy.
